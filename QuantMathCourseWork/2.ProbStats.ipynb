    "Day 1: Combinatorics and Bayes' Theorem\n",
    "Key Concepts:\n",
    "* Combinatorics: Counting methods - permutations P(n,r) = n!/(n-r)!, combinations C(n,r) = n!/(r!(n-r)!)\n",
    "* Conditional Probability: P(A|B) = P(A∩B)/P(B)\n",
    "* Bayes' Theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A)/P(B)\n",
    "* Law of Total Probability: P(B) = ΣP(B|Aᵢ)P(Aᵢ)\n",
    "Today's Problems:\n",
    "Finance Problem: A quantitative analyst is modeling credit default risk. Historical data shows:\n",
    "* 2% of all loans default (base rate)\n",
    "* A credit scoring model flags 15% of loans as \"high risk\"\n",
    "* Among loans that actually default, 80% were flagged as \"high risk\"\n",
    "* Among loans that don't default, 12% were flagged as \"high risk\"\n",
    "What's the probability that a loan flagged as \"high risk\" will actually default? Also, if the bank approves 1000 loans and can choose any 5 for detailed review, how many ways can they select these 5 loans?\n",
    "AI/ML Problem: A spam detection system processes emails with these characteristics:\n",
    "* 30% of all emails are spam\n",
    "* The word \"offer\" appears in 60% of spam emails\n",
    "* The word \"offer\" appears in 5% of legitimate emails\n",
    "* An email contains the word \"offer\"\n",
    "Calculate the probability this email is spam using Bayes' theorem. Additionally, if the system processes emails in batches of 10, and each email has a 0.3 probability of being spam (independent), what's the probability of getting exactly 3 spam emails in a batch?\n",
    "Methods to use:\n",
    "* Bayes' Theorem: P(Default|High Risk) = P(High Risk|Default) × P(Default) / P(High Risk)\n",
    "* Law of Total Probability: P(High Risk) = P(High Risk|Default)P(Default) + P(High Risk|No Default)P(No Default)\n",
    "* Combinations: C(1000,5) for loan selection\n",
    "* Binomial Probability: P(X=k) = C(n,k) × p^k × (1-p)^(n-k)\n",
    "Ready to dive into probabilistic reasoning? Type \"solve\" when you want the step-by-step solutions!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Excellent! Let me walk you through both probability problems step by step.\n",
    "Finance Problem Solution: Credit Default Risk Analysis\n",
    "Step 1: Define the events and given probabilities\n",
    "* D = Loan defaults, P(D) = 0.02\n",
    "* H = Loan flagged as \"high risk\", P(H) = 0.15\n",
    "* P(H|D) = 0.80 (80% of defaulting loans are flagged)\n",
    "* P(H|D^c) = 0.12 (12% of non-defaulting loans are flagged)\n",
    "Step 2: Verify using Law of Total Probability P(H) = P(H|D)P(D) + P(H|D^c)P(D^c) P(H) = 0.80 × 0.02 + 0.12 × 0.98 P(H) = 0.016 + 0.1176 = 0.1336\n",
    "Wait, this doesn't match the given P(H) = 0.15. Let me use the given value P(H) = 0.15 for consistency.\n",
    "Step 3: Apply Bayes' Theorem P(D|H) = P(H|D) × P(D) / P(H) P(D|H) = 0.80 × 0.02 / 0.15 P(D|H) = 0.016 / 0.15 = 0.1067 or 10.67%\n",
    "Step 4: Calculate combinations for loan selection Number of ways to select 5 loans from 1000: C(1000,5) = 1000!/(5! × 995!) C(1000,5) = (1000 × 999 × 998 × 997 × 996)/(5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) C(1000,5) = 99,009,995,001,000/120 = 8.25 × 10¹¹ ways\n",

    "AI/ML Problem Solution: Spam Detection\n",
    "Step 1: Define events and given probabilities\n",
    "* S = Email is spam, P(S) = 0.30\n",
    "* O = Email contains \"offer\", P(O|S) = 0.60, P(O|S^c) = 0.05\n",
    "Step 2: Calculate P(O) using Law of Total Probability P(O) = P(O|S)P(S) + P(O|S^c)P(S^c) P(O) = 0.60 × 0.30 + 0.05 × 0.70 P(O) = 0.18 + 0.035 = 0.215\n",
    "Step 3: Apply Bayes' Theorem P(S|O) = P(O|S) × P(S) / P(O) P(S|O) = 0.60 × 0.30 / 0.215 P(S|O) = 0.18 / 0.215 = 0.837 or 83.7%\n",
    "Step 4: Calculate binomial probability for exactly 3 spam emails We have n = 10 emails, p = 0.3 (probability of spam), k = 3\n",
    "P(X = 3) = C(10,3) × (0.3)³ × (0.7)⁷\n",
    "First, calculate C(10,3): C(10,3) = 10!/(3! × 7!) = (10 × 9 × 8)/(3 × 2 × 1) = 720/6 = 120\n",
    "Now calculate the probability: P(X = 3) = 120 × (0.3)³ × (0.7)⁷ P(X = 3) = 120 × 0.027 × 0.0823 P(X = 3) = 120 × 0.002222 = 0.267 or 26.7%\n",

    "* Prior belief: 2% of loans default (base rate)\n",
    "* Updated belief: After seeing \"high risk\" flag, probability jumps to 10.67%\n",
    "* Model effectiveness: The flag increases default probability by ~5×, showing the model has predictive value\n",
    "* Selection combinations: 825 billion ways to choose 5 loans from 1000 for review\n",
    "AI/ML Problem:\n",
    "* Prior belief: 30% chance of spam (base rate)\n",
    "* Updated belief: After seeing \"offer\", probability jumps to 83.7%\n",
    "* Strong indicator: The word \"offer\" is a powerful spam indicator (60% vs 5% occurrence rate)\n",
    "* Batch analysis: 26.7% chance of exactly 3 spam emails in a batch of 10\n",

    "* The credit model reduces uncertainty about default risk by 5×\n",
    "* The spam filter correctly identifies spam 83.7% of the time when \"offer\" is present\n",
    "* Both demonstrate how prior knowledge + evidence = better decisions"
