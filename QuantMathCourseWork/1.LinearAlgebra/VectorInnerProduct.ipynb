    "Day 1: Vectors, Vector Spaces, and Inner Product Spaces\n",
    "Let me start with the core concepts and then give you today's practical problems.\n",
    "Key Concepts:\n",
    "* Vectors: Objects that have magnitude and direction, represented as arrays of numbers\n",
    "* Vector Spaces: Collections of vectors that can be added together and multiplied by scalars\n",
    "* Inner Product: A way to multiply vectors that gives a scalar (like dot product)\n",
    "* Norm: The \"length\" of a vector, often calculated as √(v·v)\n",
    "Today's Problems:\n",
    "Finance Problem: You're analyzing a portfolio with 4 assets. The daily returns over 5 days are represented as vectors:\n",
    "* Asset A: [0.02, -0.01, 0.03, 0.01, -0.02]\n",
    "* Asset B: [0.01, 0.02, -0.01, 0.02, 0.01]\n",
    "Calculate the correlation coefficient between these two assets using vector operations (hint: use inner products and norms).\n",
    "AI/ML Problem: In a recommendation system, user preferences are represented as vectors. User 1 likes genres with weights [4, 2, 1, 3] for [Action, Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi], and User 2 has weights [3, 3, 2, 4]. Calculate the cosine similarity between these users to determine how similar their tastes are.\n",
    "Methods to use:\n",
    "* Inner product (dot product): a·b = Σ(aᵢbᵢ)\n",
    "* Vector norm: ||v|| = √(v·v)\n",
    "* Correlation coefficient: r = (a·b)/(||a|| × ||b||) after centering the data\n",
    "* Cosine similarity: cos(θ) = (a·b)/(||a|| × ||b||)\n",
    "Try these problems and when you're ready, type \"solve\" and I'll walk you through the step-by-step solutions!\n",
    "\n",
    "Finance Problem Solution: Portfolio Correlation\n",
    "Step 1: Set up the data\n",
    "* Asset A returns: [0.02, -0.01, 0.03, 0.01, -0.02]\n",
    "* Asset B returns: [0.01, 0.02, -0.01, 0.02, 0.01]\n",
    "Step 2: Calculate means\n",
    "* Mean of A: μₐ = (0.02 + (-0.01) + 0.03 + 0.01 + (-0.02))/5 = 0.03/5 = 0.006\n",
    "* Mean of B: μᵦ = (0.01 + 0.02 + (-0.01) + 0.02 + 0.01)/5 = 0.05/5 = 0.01\n",
    "Step 3: Center the data (subtract means)\n",
    "* A_centered = [0.02-0.006, -0.01-0.006, 0.03-0.006, 0.01-0.006, -0.02-0.006]\n",

    "Step 4: Calculate inner product A_centered · B_centered = (0.014×0) + (-0.016×0.01) + (0.024×-0.02) + (0.004×0.01) + (-0.026×0) = 0 + (-0.00016) + (-0.00048) + 0.00004 + 0 = -0.0006\n",
    "Step 5: Calculate norms\n",
    "* ||A_centered||² = 0.014² + (-0.016)² + 0.024² + 0.004² + (-0.026)²\n",
    "* ||A_centered||² = 0.000196 + 0.000256 + 0.000576 + 0.000016 + 0.000676 = 0.00172\n",

    "* ||B_centered||² = 0² + 0.01² + (-0.02)² + 0.01² + 0²\n",
    "* ||B_centered||² = 0 + 0.0001 + 0.0004 + 0.0001 + 0 = 0.0006\n",
    "* ||B_centered|| = √0.0006 ≈ 0.0245\n",
    "Step 6: Calculate correlation r = (A_centered · B_centered)/(||A_centered|| × ||B_centered||) r = -0.0006/(0.0415 × 0.0245) ≈ -0.0006/0.001017 ≈ -0.59\n",

    "AI/ML Problem Solution: Cosine Similarity\n",
    "Step 1: Set up user preference vectors\n",
    "* User 1: [4, 2, 1, 3] (Action, Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi)\n",

    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "* Finance: The correlation of -0.59 indicates a moderate negative correlation between assets A and B, which is good for diversification!\n",
    "* AI/ML: The cosine similarity of 0.948 is very high (close to 1), indicating these users have very similar preferences and would likely enjoy similar recommendations."
