    "Let me start with the core concepts and then give you today's practical problems.\n",

    "* Vectors: Objects that have magnitude and direction, represented as arrays of numbers\n",
    "* Vector Spaces: Collections of vectors that can be added together and multiplied by scalars\n",
    "* Inner Product: A way to multiply vectors that gives a scalar (like dot product)\n",
    "* Norm: The \"length\" of a vector, often calculated as √(v·v)\n",
    "Today's Problems:\n",
    "Finance Problem: You're analyzing a portfolio with 4 assets. The daily returns over 5 days are represented as vectors:\n",
    "* Asset A: [0.02, -0.01, 0.03, 0.01, -0.02]\n",
    "* Asset B: [0.01, 0.02, -0.01, 0.02, 0.01]\n",
    "Calculate the correlation coefficient between these two assets using vector operations (hint: use inner products and norms).\n",
    "AI/ML Problem: In a recommendation system, user preferences are represented as vectors. User 1 likes genres with weights [4, 2, 1, 3] for [Action, Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi], and User 2 has weights [3, 3, 2, 4]. Calculate the cosine similarity between these users to determine how similar their tastes are.\n",
